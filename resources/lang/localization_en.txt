Introduction

In October 2018, Everis Brasil's accessibility team researched the preferences of screen reader users in Brazil and received 312 valid Responses. This was the first survey of its kind in Brazil.

Our research was based on the WebAIM survey. The Brazilian survey questions that correlate with the WebAIM survey have links to the results of the international survey published in 2017 (Screen Reader User Survey # 7 Results).

Before reading the results, please note the following:
Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding.
The total Responses to each question may not equal 312 because the participants did not answer that particular question.
The participant group has not been controlled and may not represent all users of screen readers in Brazil.

In the future, we intend to conduct other surveys of this nature in Brazil as well as Latin America. If you have any ideas or questions, please contact us by email.
